# Hey there, I'm Dhruv ðŸ‘‹

Full Stack Engineer building scalable systems at **Enso** | IIIT Jabalpur '24

## ðŸš€ What I Do

I build high-performance distributed systems and AI-powered applications. Currently improving contract parsing accuracy with vector embeddings and semantic search at Enso.

**Recent highlights:**
- Engineered [SneakDex]([https://github.com/Sneakyhydra](https://www.dhruvrishishwar.com/projects/sneakdex/live)) â€” a production-grade distributed search engine indexing 80K+ documents with sub-second latencies
- Built microservices architecture with Go, Rust, and Python orchestrated via Kafka
- Implemented hybrid search combining vector DB and full-text search with 80%+ cache hit rates
